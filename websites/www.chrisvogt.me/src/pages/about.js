          <Themed.p>
            By day, I'm a Principal Software Engineer at GoDaddy. I've been there since 2017 — nearly nine years — and I
            work on the Airo-Growth-Innovation (AGI) team. We build intelligent customer dashboards, the recommendations
            you see across GoDaddy, and GoDaddy Airo™. This site isn't about work, though. It's where I follow my
            curiosity, experiment with ideas, and write code just for fun.

            Most evenings, you'll find me at the piano — practicing, recording, or just playing around with sound. I've
            been slowly teaching myself music, and I'm figuring out how to bring what I know from tech into making
            music. I also spend a lot of time with friends in the city and love connecting with people who are
            passionate about what they do.

            The chart below shows how my career has actually played out: print and design first (OfficeMax, FedEx
            Kinko's, then creative and freelance work), then IT and systems (contract roles, then Apogee Physicians and
            Encore Discovery Solutions), and finally a shift into software engineering that led to web and front-end
            roles and, in 2017, to GoDaddy, where I've been ever since.
